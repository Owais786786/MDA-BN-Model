A) Instructions
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
1. We used open datasets in this work and according to given instructions, we are not allowed to redistribute these datasets. Therefore, we just provided a few sample images with our code.
2. You can download all the datasets from the available resources as cited in our paper namely “Multilevel Deep-Aggregated Boosted Network to Recognize COVID-19 Infection from Large-Scale Heterogeneous Radiographic Data"
3. Any work that uses the provided pretrained network must acknowledge the authors by including the following reference.
"Muhammad Owais, Young Won Lee, Tahir Mahmood, Adnan Haider, Haseeb Sultan, and Kang Ryoung Park, “Multilevel Deep-Aggregated Boosted Network to Recognize COVID-19 Infection from Large-Scale Heterogeneous Radiographic Data,” IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, in submission"

B) How to run this code
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Step 1: Open the given code file named as "Proposed_MDA_BN_Model_Code.m" in Matlab (preferably matlab version is R2020b)
Step 2: Run this code (press F5), After execution, the code will required a user input (either 0 or 1) in a window box

Note:
->If you want to test our model for a single modality data: Enter 0 in window box and press enter
  After that select either x-ray or CT image from the given data folder namely "Sample Dataset"
->If you want to test our model for Heterogeneous Data: Enter 1 in window box and press enter
  After that select both x-ray and CT images one by one from the given data folder namely "Sample Dataset"
