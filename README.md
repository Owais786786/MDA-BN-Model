# MDA-BN-Model
Our proposed MDA-BN deep model


Instructions
1. We used open datasets in this work and according to given instructions, we are not allowed to redistribute these datasets. Therefore, we just provided a few sample images with our code.
2. You can download all the datasets from the available resources as cited in our paper namely “Multilevel Deep-Aggregated Boosted Network to Recognize COVID-19 Infection from Large-Scale Heterogeneous Radiographic Data"
3. Any work that uses the provided pretrained network must acknowledge the authors by including the following reference.
"Muhammad Owais, Young Won Lee, Tahir Mahmood, Adnan Haider, Haseeb Sultan, and Kang Ryoung Park, “Multilevel Deep-Aggregated Boosted Network to Recognize COVID-19 Infection from Large-Scale Heterogeneous Radiographic Data,” IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, in submission"
